                            During my first year as a Computer Science student,
                            I had the opportunity to take part in a freelance
                            project led by the university research group
                            Sidevsoft from Institucion Universitaria ITM. The
                            goal was ambitious: to build an educational platform
                            that would help people with hearing impairments
                            learn Spanish in an interactive and accessible way.

                            This project was born from a real and urgent need.
                            Many deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals face
                            serious challenges when trying to learn Spanish as a
                            second language, especially in digital environments
                            that aren't built with accessibility in mind. ITM,
                            as part of its commitment to inclusive education,
                            proposed the creation of a platform tailored to
                            these learners, guided by professional educators.

                            My role focused on the frontend development of the
                            platform. Specifically, I was responsible for:

                                Designing and coding the user interface where
                                students accessed their learning materials.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Developing interactive mini-games to reinforce
                                vocabulary, grammar, and visual comprehension in
                                an engaging way.
                            </li>

                            Even though we didn't use any modern frameworks like
                            React or Vue, we built everything using pure HTML,
                            CSS, and JavaScript. This meant crafting both layout
                            and logic from scratch—an experience that deeply
                            strengthened my frontend fundamentals.

                            Real-world impact

                            After our initial development phase, the project
                            moved into a pilot test with at least 100 users,
                            which validated both its educational value and
                            technical foundation. Although I wasn't part of the
                            later stages, I'm proud to have contributed to
                            something with such meaningful social impact.

                            Beyond the technical challenge, this project taught
                            me the importance of building human-centered and
                            accessible digital experiences. It reminded me that
                            as developers, we're not just solving code
                            problems—we're solving people problems.
